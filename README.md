# screencast-settings

Environment and editor settings for Treehouse teachers to use when screencasting.

This repo has subfolders for each app. Check the README.md file in each folder for setup instructions.

Where possible, each settings file is designed to alter only screen display settings, leaving your other settings untouched. Not every app supports this, however, so review the settings files to see what will be changed.
