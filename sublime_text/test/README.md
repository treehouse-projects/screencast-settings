# Setup

* Copy the `treehouse.sublime-project` file into your project directory.
* In the Sublime Text menu, choose "Project" -> "Open Project...".
* Navigate to the `treehouse.sublime-project` file within your project directory, and click the "Open" button.

Or, if you're in a hurry:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/treehouse/screencast-settings/master/sublime_text/treehouse.sublime-project > treehouse.sublime-project; subl treehouse.sublime-project
```

The project should then open with an enlarged font and with the correct color scheme.
