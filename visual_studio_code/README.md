# Setup

* Copy the `.vscode` subdirectory into your project directory.
* In the Visual Studio Code menu, choose "File" -> "Open...".
* Navigate your project directory, and click the "Open" button.

Or, if you're in a hurry:

```
TODO
```

The project should then open with a zoomed-in interface and enlarged editor and terminal fonts.

# Notes

* `"window.zoomLevel"` increases Explorer (sidebar) font size.
* Because `"window.zoomLevel"` is increased, using 14-point fonts for the editor and Terminal is equivalent to an 18-point font normally.
